Software Testing: The process of identifying defects in software to ensure quality before releasing it to customers

Manual Testing: Testing carried out by manually by a human tester without the use of automation tools.
 Types:
    Re-Testing: Testing the same functionality after defects have been fixed.
    Regression Testing: Testing to ensure that new changes do not negatively affect existing functionality.

Challenges: 
 Time: Manual testing is often slow
 Effort: It requires considerable human effort


Automation Testing: Testing that uses automation tools to executes tests.
          Key points: Automation tools require scripts, written in programming languages, to define and execute tests. Programming is essential to automate test cases, handle complex scenarios,  and integrate with other testing tools.

Selenium: Selenium is a popular open-source tool for automation web applications. 
Selenium was originally developed by Jason Huggins in 2004  at Thoughtwokrs.

Features: 
 Open source: Free to use and modify.
 Components: 
   IDE: For Creating test cases
   WebDriver: Programming interface to create and execute browser-based automation scripts.
   Grid: Allows running tests on different machines and browsers simultaneously. 

Types of applications: 3 types
Desktop applications: word, PowerPoint
Web applications: URL based applications
Mobile applications: mobile devices like smart phones and tablets

Advantages of Selenium: 
 Open Source and free: No licensing costs
 Cross-platform support: Works on multiple operating systems
 Browser compatibility: Many browsers(Chrome, Firefox and Edge).
Multi language support: various programming languages(python, C#, Ruby, JavaScript)
Integration: Can be integrated third party too;s for enhanced functionality.

Disadvantages of selenium: 
Limited Support for windows based applications: Required additional tools like Autolt, Robot API and Sikuli.
No native reporting: Need external tools TestNG or Extent reports for reporting. 
Cannot Directly handle Excel files: Require libraries like Apache POI.
Limited Support for Complex UI elements: Struggles with handling graphs and CAPTCHA.
